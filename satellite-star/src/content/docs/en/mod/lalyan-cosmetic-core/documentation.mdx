An API to register and customize cosmetics without using armor slots

Custom Wardrobe model and texture are made by [EtherealShigure](https://www.curseforge.com/members/etherealshigure).

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Introduction</span>

This plugin allows players to customize which cosmetic they have equipped, without having to use up their armor slots

It also allows plugin makers to create their custom cosmetics, without needing any java code!

The plugin features a custom GUI to customize cosmetics, which can be opened by command or, in a more immersive way, by crafting the Cosmetic Wardrobe

The Cosmetic Wardrobe can be crafted in the Builder's Workbench using 4 of any Hardwood

The GUI provides an easy way to select cosmetics and cosmetic variants. Left-click on a cosmetic to equip it, if the cosmetic has the variant icon, right-click it to open the variant menu!

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Commands</span>

The plugin includes several commands, primarily for testing purposes:

* `/cosmetic apply <Cosmetic_ID> [Override]` – Manually applies a specific cosmetic. The `[Override]` parameter is optional (default is `yes`; other value is `no`) and determines whether all other cosmetics of that type should be removed. **Requires OP.**
* `/cosmetic change` – Opens the Cosmetic Customization UI. **Does not require permissions.**
* `/cosmetic list` – Prints all loaded cosmetic IDs in the chat. **Requires OP.** Use `--permissions` to print all cosmetics alongside their relative permissions.
* `/cosmetic reload` – Manually reloads all cosmetics. **Requires OP.**
* `/cosmetic clear` – Removes all custom cosmetics and resets the default skin. **Requires OP.**
* `/cosmetic perms <Action> <Permission_Type> <Subject_Type> <Permission> <Subject>` – Checks or modifies mod permissions. **Requires OP.**

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Registering cosmetics</span>

> <span style="color:#E03E2D;">!Warning! Remember that the name you give to the files is important!</span>

Registering a cosmetic is quite simple. You'll need to make an asset pack (obviously), and will need 3 files:

*   The cosmetic's .blockymodel
*   The cosmetic's .png texture
*   The cosmetic's .png icon, which is the same icon you would use for the item!

These files must be named in the same way, that being CustomID.extension

Each cosmetic will be its own folder, with this structure

```
CustomID/
├── CustomID.blockymodel
├── CustomID.png
└── Icon/
    └── CustomID.png
```

Then the cosmetic will go in a certain folder, depending on the type:

### <span style="color:#236FA1;">Cosmetics Slots</span>

The base path for cosmetics is `Common/Resources/` (For backwards compatibility the folders `Common/Resources/Cosmetics` and `Common/Resources/Characters` are also checked), then the folder based on the slot, which can be:

*   `Capes`
*   `Ears_Accessories`
*   `Gloves`
*   `Head`
*   `Face_Accessories`
*   `Overpants`
*   `Overtops`
*   `Pants`
*   `Shoes`
*   `Undertops`
*   `Underwears`
*   `Beards`
*   `Ears`
*   `Eyebrows`
*   `Eyes`
*   `Faces`
*   `Mouth`
*   `Haircuts`
*   `Hair_Extension`
*   `Wings`
*   `Tails`
*   `Horns`
*   `Face_Details`

Then the folder you made before.

So, for a cosmetic called Custom_Cape, which is in the cape slot it would be like this:

`Common/Resources/Capes/Custom_Cape` and inside the Custom_Cape folder:

```
Custom_Cape/
├── Custom_Cape.blockymodel
├── Custom_Cape.png
└── Icon/
    └── Custom_Cape.png
```

The Hair_Extension slot automatically takes the same gradient as the Hairstyle.

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Variants (optional)</span>

> <span style="color:#E03E2D;">!Warning! Variants and colors are mutually exclusive!</span>

> <span style="color:#E03E2D;">!Warning! Hair extensions cannot have variants nor colors, they changes according to the hairstyle!</span>

This API also allows you to add variants.

To add variants, you will need to add the variant texture and icon inside your cosmetic's folder.

The variant textures must be placed in the cosmetic folder (CustomID) and named as follows:

```
CustomID_Variant_VariantName.png
```

The variant icons must have the same name given to the variant texture, but unlike the texture, they must be placed inside the `Icon/` folder.

Taking the Propeller_Hat as an example:

```
Propeller_Hat/
├── Propeller_Hat.blockymodel
├── Propeller_Hat.png
├── Propeller_Hat_Variant_Circus.png
├── Propeller_Hat_Variant_Rainbow.png
└── Icon/
    ├── Propeller_Hat.png
    ├── Propeller_Hat_Variant_Circus.png
    └── Propeller_Hat_Variant_Rainbow.png
```

Doing so, the API will load: **Propeller_Hat**, **Propeller_Hat_Variant_Circus**, **Propeller_Hat_Variant_Rainbow**.

They will be seen by the API as variants of the same cosmetic, so they will implicitly use `Propeller_Hat.blockymodel`

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Colors (optional)</span>

> <span style="color:#E03E2D;">!Warning! Variants and colors are mutually exclusive!</span>

> <span style="color:#E03E2D;">!Warning! Hair extensions cannot have variants nor colors, they change according to the hairstyle!</span>

This API also allows you to add multiple colors to a cosmetic!

To add colors you need to change the folder of your cosmetic like this: `Cosmetic_Id_Colors_GRADIENTSET`

The texture has to be grayscale (completely desaturated).

here's a list of all available gradient sets:

*   `Colored_Cotton`
*   `Eyes_Gradient`
*   `Faded_Leather`
*   `Fantasy_Cotton`
*   `Fantasy_Cotton_Dark`
*   `Flashy_Synthetic`
*   `Hair`
*   `Jean_Generic`
*   `Ornamented_Metal`
*   `Pastel_Cotton`
*   `Rotten_Fabric`
*   `Shiny_Fabric`
*   `Skin`

Here's an example:
Item name: `Sample_Shirt`
Alternative: `Colors`
Gradient Set: `Colored_Cotton`

The folder name is: `Sample_Shirt_Colors_Colored_Cotton`

The folder structure is:

```
Sample_Shirt_Colors_Colored_Cotton/
├── Sample_Shirt.blockymodel
├── Sample_Shirt.png
└── Icon/
    └── Sample_Shirt.png
```

model, texture and icon's names have to be just the name without `_Colors_GRADIENTSET`

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Advanced Cosmetics (optional)</span>

Inside your cosmetic folder, you can add a `Cosmetic_Id.json` file. This file allows you to customize even more your cosmetics.

Within the JSON file, you are able to change the name and path of the model, texture and icon of your cosmetic. And that's not all, you'll also be able to define variants and color gradients of your cosmetic and if the cosmetic occupies MORE THAN ONE SLOT!

```
{
    "Model": "Resources/Cosmetics/Head/Propeller_Hat/Propeller_Hat.blockymodel",
    "Texture": "Resources/Cosmetics/Head/Propeller_Hat/Propeller_Hat.png",
    "Icon": "Resources/Cosmetics/Head/Propeller_Hat/Propeller_Hat_Icon.png",
    "SlotOverrides": [
        //Insert slots here, for example "Head", "Capes" etc
    ],
    "Alternatives": {
        //THESE 2 ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, YOU EITHER HAVE VARIANTS OR COLORS!!!
        //Choice 1 (Colors)
        "Gradient_Set": "Hair",
        //Choice 2 (Variants)
        "Variants": {

    },
    "Default_Color": {
        "Gradient_Set": "Hair",
        "Gradient_Id": "Red"
    }

## <span style="color:#3598DB;">Custom Categories and Slots</span>

Since version 2.0, you can also add custom Categories (The left-most buttons) and Slots (The middle-left buttons).

Categories are purely cosmetic, while slots can also be used when making a cosmetic

Cosmetic json schema:
```json
{
  "Name": "Capes"
}
```

`Name`: The name to display when hovering over the button, also used when assigning it to a slot, CAN ONLY HAVE UPPERCASE OR LOWERCASE LETTERS, CANNOT HAVE NUMBERS, UNDERSCORES OR ANY OTHER SPECIAL CHARACTER

Slot json schema:
```json
{
  "Name": "Capes",
  "Icon": "UI/Custom/Common/Categories/Categories/Capes.png",
  "SelectedIcon": "UI/Custom/Common/Categories/Categories/Selected/Capes.png",
  "TopLevelCategory": "Capes",
  "Camera": {
    "Distance": 2,
    "Position_Offset": {
      "X": 0.0,
      "Y": -0.3,
      "Z": 0.0
    },
    "LookAtBack": true
  },
  "CanVanish": true
}
```

`Name`: The name to display when hovering over the button, also used when assigning it to a cosmetic, CAN ONLY HAVE UPPERCASE OR LOWERCASE LETTERS, CANNOT HAVE NUMBERS, UNDERSCORES OR ANY OTHER SPECIAL CHARACTER <br>
`Icon`: The icon of the button <br>
`SelectedIcon`: The icon of the button used when the slot is the current one being displayed <br>
`TopLevelCategory`: The category that will be assigned to the slot (see above) <br>
`Camera`: The camera settings used when this slot is selected <br>
`CanVanish`: Whether the slot has a vanish button (Faces is the only "vanilla" one that doesn't) <br>

## <span style="color:#3598db">Permissions (optional)</span>

Permissions can be enabled trough the <a href="#enable-permissions">configuration file</a>.

The permissions are made like this: `lalyancosmeticcore.[FIELD].[ID].[ACTION]`

##### <span style="color:#236fa1">Vanilla</span>
If you aren't using luckperms the mod will automatically use the vanilla permission's system.

##### <span style="color:#236fa1">Luckperms</span>
If you are using luckperms the mod will automatically use the luckperms permission's system.

### <span style="color:#236fa1">Fields</span>
The fields are permissions' groups.

##### <span style="color:#236fa1">Cosmetic</span>
the `cosmetic` field is for get the permissions for a specific cosmetic.

It's written like this: `lalyancosmeticcore.cosmetic.[Cosmetic_ID].[ACTION]`.

A few examples:
> `lalyancosmeticcore.cosmetic.GoodWitchLalya:ExampleCosmetics#Propeller_Hat.use`<br/>
> `lalyancosmeticcore.cosmetic.GoodWitchLalya:ExampleCosmetics#Rainbow_Shirt.use`

If you want to know how's written a permission for a specific cosmetic you can sue `/cosmetic list --permissions` to get a list of all of the permissions

##### <span style="color:#236fa1">Slot</span>
the `slot` field is for get the permissions for a specific slot and all of its cosmetics.

It's written like this: `lalyancosmeticcore.slot.[Slot_ID].[ACTION]`.

A few examples:
> `lalyancosmeticcore.slot.Head.use`<br/>
> `lalyancosmeticcore.slot.Overpants.use`

the list with all of the slots: <a href="#characters">Here</a>(character), <a href="#cosmetics">Here</a>(cosmetic)

### <span style="color:#236fa1">Action</span>
at the moment ther's only one action, `use`.

##### <span style="color:#236fa1">Use</span>

this permission decides if a player can view and set a cosmetic or a view slot.

## <span style="color:#3598db">Configuration (optional)</span>

At the moment the configuration file only has the `Enable Permissions` voice.

### <span style="color:#236fa1">Enable Permissions</span>

The configuration for the **Enable Permissions** value works this way:

If the value is **true**: <br/>
The permission system will be enabled letting a player use a cosmetic only if they have the right permission.

If the value is **false**: <br/>
The API will work as it always has: Everyone can use everything.

This value is set to **false** by default.
