Ancient Golemancy is a mod for Hytale that aims to provide the tools to build your own logistical infrastructure, not using pipes or any conventional method, but instead golem's work!

While wandering around the world, you'll be able to find ruins of a long gone orbis civilization, that goes back to when Gaia was still at the peak of her powers.

This civilization was known for expanding throughout the whole world, using their creations as a way to automate menial and repetitive tasks, as such no matter where you are in the world, it's possible to find remnants.

In these ruins, you'll be able to master the art of golemancy, a long gone form of magic that, while still present in the form of rudimentary guardians, has been mostly lost to time.
Using this art and a bit of iron, you'll be able to make and command your own army of golems, some big some small, and make them do almost anything your heart desires!

You will fuse the golem's hearth gem and the magic it reeks with the cold metal, a medley of magic and engineering to create a powerful golem.

To get started, you need to find one of these ruins, that can be distinguished by the prominent banners that were somehow able to resist the passage of time, and locate the Runic Table (while also snagging some good loot along the way)

Using this table, you'll craft not only Golems, but also Runic Tablets which are needed to give commands to the golems.
